=============================================

A collection of ubuntu scripts to fix problems and add functionalities.

Compatible with any Debian based system:

Highly compatible with 17.04 (Zesty).

**Used on [ubunsys](https://github.com/adgellida/ubunsys)**

Is more desirable that you use "Scripts Manager" functionality of [ubunsys](https://github.com/adgellida/ubunsys) to execute these scripts.

Nowadays if you want to do it "manual way"...

**Manual**

Then do these basics steps:

1. Add exec permissions to all scripts!

`sudo chmod 777 archiveName`

`sudo chmod 777 -R folderName`
